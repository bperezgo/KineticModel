# KineticModel
# by: Bryan Stiven Pérez Gómez

Module to calculate the kinetic constants of any first order reaction.

Interfaz.xlsx is to input the necessary data: Reactions and Experimental data.

Principal.py is to run the code.

Results.xlsx is to output the results: Kinetic constants and Arrhenius parameters.

This module can be modified because this is still in maintenance.
